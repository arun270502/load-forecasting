Understanding the expected amount of electricity consumed is an important piece of effectively delivering electricity to the grid. If too much is sent, grid overload can occur and leave a negative impact on the environment. Too little electricity can lead to inconsistent service for customers.

Our project is aimed at finding a simple way to reasonably predict the amount of electricity a subset of the grid will use. Through simple regression models, electricity consumption can be predicted and providers can appropriately prepare and adjust their delivery of the service. This is not only useful for service providers, but also consumers who might want to estimate costs.
